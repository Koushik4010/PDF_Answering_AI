# PDF Answering AI (QA System)

This project demonstrates a question-answering (QA) system for processing large PDFs. The goal is to create a QA system that can accurately interpret and respond to questions based on the content of a given document. This system is particularly useful for applications such as automated customer service, academic research assistance, and content summarization.

## Features

* **Text Extraction:** Reliable method to extract text from PDF documents.
* **Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the extracted text to ensure it is suitable for NLP tasks.
* **Embedding:** Implement a method to convert text into embeddings for similarity search.
* **QA System Implementation:** Use a pre-trained language model to build a QA system.
* **Evaluation:** Measure the performance of the QA system using various metrics.

**Requirements:**

* Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
